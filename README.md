# ShopEase E-Commerce Web Application

## Project Overview

ShopEase is a full-stack e-commerce solution built with a Blazor WebAssembly front-end and a .NET 8 Web API back-end, following Clean Architecture principles. The project is structured with top-level `src` and `tests` folders to maintain separation of concerns, ensure maintainability, and support scalable, testable development.

Key backend technologies include Entity Framework with SQLite for data persistence and ASP.NET Identity with JWT token-based authentication for secure access control. The Web API will expose endpoints documented through OpenAPI (Swagger) for ease of integration and testing.

## ðŸ”§ Architecture & Design Patterns

- **CQRS Pattern via MediatR** to separate command and query responsibilities
- **AutoMapper** for seamless object-to-object mapping
- **FluentValidation** for enforcing input validation rules
- **Generic repositories and services** (`IRepository<T>`, `IService<T>`) alongside concrete implementations per domain entity
- **Clean layering** across domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation for modularity and testing

## ðŸ“˜ Project Activities and Milestones

### ðŸ”¹ Activity 1: Business Logic & Domain Modeling

- Define domain models:
  - **Product:** includes ProductID, Name, Price, and Category
  - **Cart:** manages a list of Product items with methods like AddProduct, RemoveProduct, DisplayCartItems, and CalculateTotal
- Implement CRUD operations for Product and Cart through the API
- Integrate SQLite as the relational database backend
- Write unit tests for core business logic and repository behavior
- Use GitHub Copilot to support debugging and code improvements

### ðŸ”¹ Activity 2: Blazor Components for Product Listings

- Build a reusable component: `ProductCard.razor`
- Display dynamic product information
- Include an "Add to Cart" button with event-based data communication
- Use data binding and event callbacks to pass selected products to the cart
- Ensure proper component interaction and test with multiple products
- Use Copilot to refine component logic and performance

### ðŸ”¹ Activity 3: UI/UX and Responsive Design

- Style components using `site.css` for improved readability and layout consistency
- Implement responsive design with CSS media queries to support various screen sizes
- Enhance accessibility: high contrast, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML
- Use Copilot to review and enhance UI/UX design and accessibility

### ðŸ”¹ Activity 4: Security and Authentication

- Implement ASP.NET Identity with JWT-based authentication
- Protect API endpoints so only authenticated users can perform cart operations
- Sanitize inputs and apply FluentValidation to prevent common attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
- Utilize Copilot to review for security flaws and suggest best practices
- Secure frontend API calls by passing and validating JWT tokens

### ðŸ”¹ Activity 5: State Management and Finalization

- Implement state persistence using localStorage or sessionStorage to retain cart data across sessions
- Validate the complete user journey: login, product listing, add/remove cart items, and session continuity
- Conduct end-to-end testing across all application layers
- Optimize for performance and finalize for peer review and portfolio presentation

## âœ… Conclusion

The ShopEase application is designed as a modern, secure, and maintainable e-commerce solution built with the latest .NET 8 stack. By leveraging Clean Architecture and key design patterns, the project promotes scalability, code clarity, and modular development. Upon completion, ShopEase will be a polished, peer-review-ready application demonstrating real-world full-stack development practices with secure authentication, responsive UI, and state management.

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Commands to Implement ShopEase in VS Code

### 1. Create Solution & Folder Structure

```sh
mkdir ShopEase && cd ShopEase
mkdir src tests
dotnet new sln -n ShopEase
dotnet new webapi -n ShopEase.Api -o src/ShopEase.Api
dotnet new classlib -n ShopEase.Domain -o src/ShopEase.Domain
dotnet new classlib -n ShopEase.Application -o src/ShopEase.Application
dotnet new classlib -n ShopEase.Infrastructure -o src/ShopEase.Infrastructure
dotnet new blazorwasm -n ShopEase.Blazor -o src/ShopEase.Blazor
dotnet new xunit -n ShopEase.Tests -o tests/ShopEase.Tests
dotnet sln add src/ShopEase.*
dotnet sln add tests/ShopEase.Tests
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Api reference src/ShopEase.Application src/ShopEase.Infrastructure src/ShopEase.Domain
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Application reference src/ShopEase.Domain
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Infrastructure reference src/ShopEase.Domain
dotnet add tests/ShopEase.Tests reference src/ShopEase.Application src/ShopEase.Infrastructure src/ShopEase.Domain
```

### 2. Install Required NuGet Packages

```sh
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Application package MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Application package AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Application package FluentValidation
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Infrastructure package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Infrastructure package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Infrastructure package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Api package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
dotnet add src/ShopEase.Api package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
dotnet add tests/ShopEase.Tests package Moq
dotnet add tests/ShopEase.Tests package FluentAssertions
```

### 3. Domain Modeling & Business Logic

- Create `Product` and `Cart` models in `src/ShopEase.Domain/Entities`.
- Implement repositories and services in `src/ShopEase.Application` and `src/ShopEase.Infrastructure`.
- Use MediatR for CQRS handlers.
- Use AutoMapper for DTO mapping.
- Use FluentValidation for input validation.

### 4. Database Setup & Migrations

```sh
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --project src/ShopEase.Infrastructure --startup-project src/ShopEase.Api
dotnet ef database update --project src/ShopEase.Infrastructure --startup-project src/ShopEase.Api
```

### 5. API & Swagger

- Implement Product and Cart CRUD endpoints in `ShopEase.Api`.
- Enable Swagger in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
// ...existing code...
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
// ...existing code...
```

- Run API:

```sh
dotnet run --project src/ShopEase.Api
```

- Open Swagger UI at `https://localhost:5001/swagger`.

### 6. Authentication & Security

- Configure ASP.NET Identity and JWT in `ShopEase.Api`.
- Protect endpoints with `[Authorize]`.
- Use FluentValidation for DTOs.
- Sanitize all inputs.

### 7. Blazor Frontend

- Build `ProductCard.razor` and cart components in `src/ShopEase.Blazor/Components`.
- Use HttpClient to call API endpoints.
- Implement authentication using JWT (store token in localStorage).
- Use data binding and event callbacks for cart actions.

### 8. Styling & Responsive Design

- Edit `src/ShopEase.Blazor/wwwroot/css/site.css` for styles and media queries.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility.

### 9. State Management

- Use localStorage/sessionStorage in Blazor for cart persistence.
- Validate user journey: login, product listing, cart actions.

### 10. Testing

```sh
dotnet test tests/ShopEase.Tests
```

- Write unit tests for business logic, repositories, and API endpoints.

### 11. Debug & Refine

- Use VS Code breakpoints and debugger (`F5`).
- Use Copilot for code suggestions and improvements.

### 12. Finalization

- Optimize code and UI.
- Conduct peer review.
- Prepare for portfolio/demo.
